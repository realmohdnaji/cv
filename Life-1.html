  <p><em>Life and our understanding of it was considered an intellectual dillema from the dawn of time, thought schools, prophets, philosphers, scientists and each and every human being have incounterd this question once or twice at least in their span of life whether they made any progress in answering it or not.</em></p>

  <h3>What is <strong>life</strong> ?</h3>
  <p>Life in general includes everything exists over the crust of earth and underneath it, but speaking in a little bit of detail - Life (especially in terms of human beings) mean the intangible world that one's create and then practices in the tangible world such as beliefs, opinions and so on.</p>
<p>Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have died), or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential synthetic life as "living". Biology is the science concerned with the study of life.

There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of life. One popular definition is that organisms are open systems that maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve. However, several other definitions have been proposed, and there are some borderline cases of life, such as viruses or viroids.

Abiogenesis is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. The prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but a gradual process of increasing complexity. Life on Earth first appeared as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.[1][2][3][4] The earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria.[5][6] Researchers generally think that current life on Earth descends from an RNA world,[7] although RNA-based life may not have been the first life to have existed.[8][9] The classic 1952 Millerâ€“Urey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early Earth. Complex organic molecules occur in the Solar System and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth.[10][11][12][13]</p>
